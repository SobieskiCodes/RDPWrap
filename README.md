# RDPWrap + win 10 privacy
Since so many people still use / find this, I've gone ahead and updated it, @sebaxakerhtc has streamlined the process.
This repo is using Github actions, watching [sebaxakerhtc's](https://github.com/sebaxakerhtc/rdpwrap/) modified version of RDPWrap & ini file.
Included is win10privacy to block windows updates.
UNINSTALL YOUR CURRENT RDPWRAP IF IT IS INSTALLED, REBOOT THE MACHINE BEFORE STARTING THIS.


## Setup


```css
Disable your antivirus software
Run Installer or Installer Black
Add exclusion for "C:\Program Files\RDP Wrapper" folder
Right-click W10Privacy.exe and choose Run as administrator from the context menu. Choose to make a system restore point. Itâ€™s also worth making a full system backup (just in case).
Go to Extras > Windows Updates to manage the options. There are six different check boxes.
Check the first five options
Click Set changed settings
Enable your antivirus software
Enjoy!
```
