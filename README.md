# RDPWrap 1.6.2 + win 10 privacy

RDPWrap 1.6.2 for windows 10 home builds v18362.267 through 18362.418, and win10privacy to block windows updates.

## Setup


```css
Download the full zip and extract.
Run install.bat
Move all files from the zip into /programfiles/rdpwrap
Run autoupdate as admin
Run RDPConf.exe to verify working condition.
Right-click W10Privacy.exe and choose Run as administrator from the context menu. Choose to make a system restore point. It’s also worth making a full system backup (just in case).
Go to Extras > Windows Updates to manage the options. There are six different check boxes.
Check the first five options
Click Set changed settings
```
